# Triaging ServiceNow Incidents

Create, triage, investigate, and analyze incidents. See `references/incident-fields.md` for the priority matrix, states, categories, and encoded query patterns.

## Workflows

### 1. List Recent Incidents

Get a summary of recent incidents by priority, state, or assignment group.

**Progress checklist** (copy into your response):
```
- [ ] Query incidents with filters
- [ ] Summarize by priority and state
- [ ] Highlight critical/P1 incidents
```

1. List recent incidents (last 24 hours, open):
   ```
   list_records(table_name="incident", query="active=true^sys_created_on>=javascript:gs.daysAgoStart(1)", fields="number,short_description,priority,state,assignment_group,assigned_to,sys_created_on", limit=20, order_by="-priority")
   ```
2. For a specific assignment group:
   ```
   list_records(table_name="incident", query="active=true^assignment_groupLIKE<group_name>", fields="number,short_description,priority,state,assigned_to", limit=20)
   ```
3. Summarize: total count, breakdown by priority (P1/P2/P3/P4), breakdown by state, highlight any P1/P2 incidents.

### 2. Triage a New Incident

Assess impact and urgency, then suggest priority, category, and assignment group.

**Progress checklist:**
```
- [ ] Get incident details
- [ ] Assess impact and urgency
- [ ] Check affected CI and its dependencies
- [ ] Suggest priority, category, assignment group
- [ ] Recommend next steps
```

1. Get the incident details:
   ```
   get_record(table_name="incident", sys_id="<incident_sys_id>")
   ```
2. If a CI is attached, check its relationships to assess blast radius:
   ```
   get_ci(sys_id="<cmdb_ci_sys_id>")
   get_ci_relationships(sys_id="<cmdb_ci_sys_id>")
   ```
3. Look for similar recent incidents (same CI or category):
   ```
   list_records(table_name="incident", query="cmdb_ci=<ci_sys_id>^sys_created_on>=javascript:gs.daysAgoStart(30)", fields="number,short_description,state,priority", limit=10)
   ```
4. Recommend triage decisions:
   - **Priority:** Based on impact x urgency matrix (see `references/incident-fields.md`)
   - **Category:** Based on the affected CI class and description keywords
   - **Assignment group:** Based on CI ownership or category routing rules
5. Present recommendations with reasoning.

### 3. Investigate an Incident

Deep-dive into an existing incident — full context, related CIs, similar incidents.

**Progress checklist:**
```
- [ ] Get full incident details
- [ ] Get affected CI details and relationships
- [ ] Find similar recent incidents
- [ ] Check for related problems or changes
- [ ] Summarize findings and recommend actions
```

1. Get the full incident record:
   ```
   get_record(table_name="incident", sys_id="<incident_sys_id>")
   ```
2. If a CI is attached, get its details and dependency chain:
   ```
   get_ci(sys_id="<cmdb_ci_sys_id>")
   get_ci_relationships(sys_id="<cmdb_ci_sys_id>")
   ```
3. Find similar recent incidents:
   ```
   list_records(table_name="incident", query="categoryLIKE<category>^sys_created_on>=javascript:gs.daysAgoStart(30)", fields="number,short_description,state,priority,resolution_notes", limit=10)
   ```
4. Check for related problems:
   ```
   list_records(table_name="problem", query="cmdb_ci=<ci_sys_id>^active=true", fields="number,short_description,state", limit=5)
   ```
5. Check for recent changes on the same CI:
   ```
   list_records(table_name="change_request", query="cmdb_ci=<ci_sys_id>^sys_created_on>=javascript:gs.daysAgoStart(7)", fields="number,short_description,state,type", limit=5)
   ```
6. Summarize: incident context, CI dependency impact, related incidents/problems/changes, recommended actions.

### 4. Create an Incident

Create a new incident with validated fields and appropriate defaults.

**Progress checklist:**
```
- [ ] Validate required fields are provided
- [ ] Suggest category from description
- [ ] Set appropriate defaults (state, priority)
- [ ] Create the incident
- [ ] Confirm creation with INC number
```

1. Validate required fields: `short_description` is mandatory. Confirm `caller_id` is provided.
2. Suggest category based on description keywords (see `references/incident-fields.md`).
3. Set defaults for missing fields:
   - `state`: 1 (New)
   - `impact`: 3 (Low) unless specified
   - `urgency`: 3 (Low) unless specified
   - `priority` is auto-calculated from impact x urgency
4. Create the incident:
   ```
   create_record(table_name="incident", data={"short_description": "...", "description": "...", "caller_id": "...", "category": "...", "impact": "3", "urgency": "3", "cmdb_ci": "..."})
   ```
5. Confirm creation: return the INC number, priority, and link.

### 5. Bulk Analysis

Analyze incident trends — top categories, repeat offenders, SLA status.

**Progress checklist:**
```
- [ ] Pull recent incidents (7-30 day window)
- [ ] Group by category
- [ ] Identify repeat CIs (frequent flyers)
- [ ] Check SLA breaches
- [ ] Present trends and recommendations
```

1. Pull recent incidents:
   ```
   list_records(table_name="incident", query="sys_created_on>=javascript:gs.daysAgoStart(30)^active=true", fields="number,category,cmdb_ci,priority,state,assignment_group,sla_due", limit=100, order_by="-sys_created_on")
   ```
2. Group by category — which categories generate the most incidents?
3. Identify repeat CIs — which CIs appear in multiple incidents?
   ```
   list_records(table_name="incident", query="cmdb_ci=<frequent_ci_sys_id>^sys_created_on>=javascript:gs.daysAgoStart(30)", fields="number,short_description,priority,state", limit=20)
   ```
4. Check for SLA breaches:
   ```
   list_records(table_name="incident", query="active=true^sla_due<javascript:gs.daysAgoEnd(0)", fields="number,short_description,priority,sla_due,assignment_group", limit=20)
   ```
5. Present: top incident categories, repeat-offender CIs, SLA breach count, recommendations for reducing incident volume.

## Tips

- The priority matrix is `impact x urgency` — see `references/incident-fields.md` for the full mapping.
- Use `active=true` to filter out resolved/closed incidents. Closed incidents have `state=7`.
- SLA fields (`sla_due`, `made_sla`) track whether response/resolution targets are met.
- Assignment groups can be looked up: `list_records(table_name="sys_user_group", query="nameLIKE<keyword>", fields="name,sys_id")`.
- See `references/incident-fields.md` for encoded query patterns and field reference.
